# Retail Sales Data Cleaning & EDA

## Overview
This project performs **data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a real retail sales dataset.  
It demonstrates how to load, clean, visualize, and analyze sales data using Python.

## Dataset
- Source: Public sample dataset from Plotly (`retail_sales.csv`)
- Contains monthly retail sales data
- Columns include:
  - `Month` – month of observation
  - `Retail Sales` – total sales for that month

## Tools / Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading** – Load the CSV dataset into a Pandas DataFrame  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Check for missing values and ensure correct types  
3. **EDA & Visualization** – Explore trends, plot retail sales over time  
4. **Monthly Analysis** – Group data by month to identify seasonal patterns

## Key Findings
- Retail sales fluctuate seasonally, with peaks during certain months  
- Dataset is clean and ready for analysis  
- Visualizations reveal clear trends over time

## How to Run
1. Open `retail_sales_eda.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**  
2. Run all code cells step-by-step to see cleaning, analysis, and plots
